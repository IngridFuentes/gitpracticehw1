1 - I created a repo on Github \
2 - I cloned it to my local machine with git clone \
3 - Being in that new directory, I added two files from the terminal using touch one.txt and touch two.txt \
4 - I added text in the one.txt file \
5 - I pushed the code to github following these steps: git add . git commit -m "Text added" and git push to the master branch \
6 - To rename the branch: git checkout -b main
